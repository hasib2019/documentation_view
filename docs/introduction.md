### Getting Started
To get started, create a new application in your [developer settings](/dev-setings) , then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to
access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go live, publish it to our [integrations directory](/integration-dir) to
reach the Protocol community.
